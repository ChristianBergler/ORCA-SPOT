"""
The AUCMeter measures the area under the receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) curve for binary classification problems. The area under the curve (AUC)
can be interpreted as the probability that, given a randomly selected positive
example and a randomly selected negative example, the positive example is
assigned a higher score by the classification model than the negative example.

The AUCMeter is designed to operate on one-dimensional Tensors `output`
and `target`, where (1) the `output` contains model output scores that ought to
be higher when the model is more convinced that the example should be positively
labeled, and smaller when the model believes the example should be negatively
labeled (for instance, the output of a signoid function); and (2) the `target`
contains only values 0 (for negative examples) and 1 (for positive examples).
